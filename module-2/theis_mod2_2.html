	class="intro">
	My name is Rachel Theis, and I am creating this website for Module 2.2 in CSD 340
	at Bellevue University. <span class="sentence"> I am a student majoring in Software Development. </span> 
	I am 27 years old, and I work at Target as a team lead while I pursue my degree. I am a team 
	lead of specialty sales, so I am responsible for the following work centers: style, 
	tech, entertainment, home decor, and beauty. I like how my job allows me to be creative
	and is fast-paced and challenging.
	</p> 
	<p>
	When I am not working or studying, I have a few hobbies to keep myself busy. I like to
	cook and bake, especially in the winter (when I prefer to stay inside and avoid the cold
	as much as I can!). My favorite thing to bake is sourdough bread. I also like to read, 
	try new restaurants, explore my city, and travel when I can. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Family and friends are very important to me, and I like to spend as much time with them as 
	I can. I have one younger sister named Amy who is 24 years old. I have two cats named
	Samson and George (both adorable). 
	</p>
	<p>
	In the new year, I have a few goals and resolutions. I want to make time to take a few vacations
	since I didn't travel as much as I wanted to in 2024, and escaping the Minnesota winters
	is necessary. I also want to better define my career path and decide if I am interested
	in growing with Target or if I would prefer to explore external opportunities. Lastly, I
	want to move into a new apartment in Minneapolis so I can be closer to my friends and 
	be in a neighborhood I love.
